# ARTech
AR project for Technologiehalle

## Installation
Download this git repo and add the Vuforia Package in form of *.tgz to the Packages directory. In the manifest.json file in the Packages directory the version of the Vuforia Package needs to be changed accordingly.
If you do not yet have a *.tgz file with the Package you can start a new Project as described [here](https://developer.vuforia.com/library/getting-started/vuforia-engine-package-unity) and then copy the *.tgz file to the git directory.
